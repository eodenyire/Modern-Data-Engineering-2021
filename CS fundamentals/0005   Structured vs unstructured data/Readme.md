# Lesson 5: Structured vs. Unstructured Data

Objective: Introduce students to the differences between structured and unstructured data, and how data engineers handle these data types in various contexts.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Data Types:

Explanation of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Understanding the characteristics and challenges associated with each type.
Structured Data:

Definition of structured data and examples (relational databases, spreadsheets).
Advantages and limitations of structured data.
Unstructured Data:

Definition of unstructured data and examples (text documents, images, audio, video).
Discussing the challenges of extracting insights from unstructured data.
Semi-Structured Data:

Definition of semi-structured data and examples (JSON, XML).
Comparing semi-structured data to structured and unstructured data.
Handling Structured Data:

Using SQL for querying and managing structured data in relational databases.
Challenges in Unstructured Data Handling:

Discussing techniques for preprocessing and analyzing unstructured data.
Introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.
Activities and Exercises:

Data Type Identification:

Present different datasets and ask students to identify whether the data is structured, unstructured, or semi-structured.
SQL Query Practice:

Provide sample structured data and ask students to write SQL queries to retrieve specific information.
Unstructured Data Exploration:

Students can experiment with simple text analysis tasks using Python libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
Assessment:

Data Type Analysis:

Assign a dataset and ask students to analyze and categorize its components as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
SQL Query Quiz:

Test students' ability to write SQL queries to retrieve data from a given structured dataset.
Additional Tips:

Real-Life Scenarios: Provide examples of where structured and unstructured data are commonly encountered in data engineering tasks.

Case Studies: Share real-world use cases where data engineers have successfully processed and analyzed unstructured data for valuable insights.

Guest Speaker: Invite a guest speaker who works with unstructured data to share their experiences and insights.

Hands-On Labs: Organize hands-on labs where students work with sample datasets to practice identifying and working with different data types.

Group Discussion: Facilitate discussions on the challenges and opportunities presented by unstructured data in the context of data engineering.

Understanding the distinctions between structured and unstructured data is crucial for data engineers as they encounter diverse data sources in their work. This knowledge will guide their decisions on data storage, processing, and analysis strategies.
