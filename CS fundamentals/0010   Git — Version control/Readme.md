# Lesson 10: Git â€” Version Control

Objective: Introduce students to the concept of version control and the Git system for tracking changes in code and collaborative development.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Version Control:

Explanation of version control and its importance in collaborative software development.
Overview of centralized and distributed version control systems.
Git Basics:

Introduction to Git as a distributed version control system.
Explanation of repositories, commits, and branches.
Initializing a Repository:

Creating a new Git repository using git init.
Understanding the .git directory and its contents.
Tracking Changes:

Adding files to the staging area using git add.
Committing changes using git commit.
Branching and Merging:

Creating branches with git branch and switching between them using git checkout.
Merging branches using git merge.
Collaborative Workflows:

Cloning remote repositories using git clone.
Pulling and pushing changes to remote repositories using git pull and git push.
Understanding Git Workflow:

Explanation of common Git workflows (feature branching, pull requests, code reviews).
Activities and Exercises:

Git Repository Setup:

Students create a local Git repository, add files, and make initial commits.
Branching Practice:

Assign tasks where students create branches, make changes, and merge them back.
Assessment:

Repository Management Task:

Assign a task where students manage a repository, create branches, and merge changes.
Git Concepts Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of Git concepts, commands, and workflows.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Encourage students to work with a sample repository to practice Git commands and workflows.

Visual Aids: Use diagrams to illustrate branching, merging, and remote repository interactions.

Collaboration Simulation: Simulate a collaborative workflow where students play different roles (developer, reviewer) in a team.

Git Hosting Platforms: Introduce students to platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for hosting repositories and collaborative work.

Troubleshooting Tips: Teach students how to resolve common Git issues like conflicts and rollbacks.

Case Studies: Share examples of open-source projects that use Git for collaboration and version control.

Understanding Git and version control is crucial for data engineers, as they work on code, scripts, and configurations that need to be tracked, reviewed, and managed collaboratively. This knowledge will enhance their ability to work effectively in team environments and maintain a well-organized codebase.
