# Lesson 7: Linux and Command Line Interface (CLI)
Part 3: Shell Scripting

Objective: Introduce students to shell scripting, enabling them to automate tasks and create custom scripts for efficient data processing.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Shell Scripting:

Definition of shell scripting and its role in automating repetitive tasks.
Overview of shell languages (bash, sh) and their use in scripting.
Shell Basics:

Refreshing the command line basics.
Understanding environment variables, command substitution, and process redirection.
Writing Basic Scripts:

Creating and executing a simple shell script.
Displaying messages, variables, and basic user input.
Conditional Statements:

Using if statements for conditional execution.
Implementing branching logic based on conditions.
Looping Constructs:

Using for and while loops to iterate over data and perform actions.
Applying loops for batch processing tasks.
Functions and Modularization:

Defining functions to encapsulate code.
Benefits of modularization and reusability.
Activities and Exercises:

Script Writing Exercise:

Students write a simple script that greets the user based on the time of day.
Conditional Logic Practice:

Assign tasks that involve creating scripts with conditional statements to perform different actions.
Assessment:

Shell Script Challenge:

Assign a task that requires students to create a script that processes a batch of files based on specific conditions.
Shell Script Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to evaluate students' understanding of scripting basics, conditional statements, and looping constructs.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Coding: Encourage students to actively write and execute scripts during class.

Practice Environment: Provide a sandbox environment where students can experiment with writing and running scripts.

Real-Life Use Cases: Discuss how shell scripting is used in data engineering for tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading.

Debugging Techniques: Teach students how to troubleshoot and debug scripts, including using print statements and error messages.

Resource Sharing: Share sample scripts and code snippets for common shell scripting tasks.

Group Scripting Project: Assign a collaborative project where students work together to create a more complex shell script.

Shell scripting is a valuable skill for data engineers to automate routine tasks, streamline data processing workflows, and create efficient data pipelines. By mastering shell scripting, students can significantly enhance their productivity and effectiveness in a Linux environment.
