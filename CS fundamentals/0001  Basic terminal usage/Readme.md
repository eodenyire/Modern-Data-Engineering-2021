# Lesson 1: Basic Terminal Usage

<b>Objective:</b> Introduce students to the fundamental concepts of working with the command-line interface (CLI) and mastering basic terminal usage.

# Topics Covered:

<b>i. Introduction to the Command-Line Interface (CLI):</b></p>

* Understanding the purpose and benefits of using the CLI.
* Differentiating between CLI and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
* Brief history of command-line interfaces.

<b>ii. Navigating the File System:</b></p>
- Using commands like ls, cd, and pwd to navigate and explore the file system.
- Understanding the directory structure, paths, and current working directory.
  
<b>iii. File and Directory Operations:</b></p>
- Creating and deleting directories with mkdir and rmdir.</p>
- Creating, copying, moving, and deleting files with touch, cp, mv, and rm.</p>

<b>iv. Text Manipulation:</b></p>
- Viewing file content using cat and less.
- Searching within files using grep.
- Redirecting input and output with > and >>.
  
<b>v. Text Editors:</b></p>

- Introduction to basic text editors like Nano or Vim.
- Editing and saving files using a text editor.

<b>Activities and Exercises:</b></p>

<b>i. Navigating and Manipulating Files:</b></p>

Students practice navigating through directories, creating files and directories, and performing basic operations.

<b>ii. Text Manipulation Challenges:

Provide students with text files and ask them to perform specific tasks, such as searching for specific text using grep.

<b>iii. Text Editor Interaction:</b></p>

Students experiment with creating and editing text files using a basic text editor like Nano.

<b><p>Assessment:</b></p>

<b>i. CLI Task Challenge:</b></p>

* Assign a set of tasks that require students to use various CLI commands to navigate, create, and manipulate files and directories.

<b>ii. Text Editor Challenge:</b></p>

* Ask students to create and edit a text file using a text editor, showcasing their proficiency in basic text editing.

<p><b>Additional Tips:</b></p>

* <p>Interactive Demos: Incorporate live demonstrations to illustrate the execution of commands and their outcomes.</p>

* <p>Practice Drills: Allow students to practice repeatedly, as this helps solidify their understanding of commands and operations.</p>

* <p>Real-World Context: Connect the concepts to real-world scenarios. Explain how terminal skills are applied in data engineering tasks.</p>

* <p>Feedback and Q&A: Provide ample opportunities for students to ask questions and seek clarification on commands and concepts.</p>

* <p>Resource Sharing: Share recommended online resources and tutorials for students to continue practicing and learning outside of class.</p>

This revised lesson plan should accurately address the focus on "Basic Terminal Usage" as a part of the "Computer Science Fundamentals" category.</p>
