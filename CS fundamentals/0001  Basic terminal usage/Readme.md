Introduction to basic text editors like Nano or Vim.
Editing and saving files using a text editor.
Activities and Exercises:

Navigating and Manipulating Files:

Students practice navigating through directories, creating files and directories, and performing basic operations.
Text Manipulation Challenges:

Provide students with text files and ask them to perform specific tasks, such as searching for specific text using grep.
Text Editor Interaction:</b></p>

Students experiment with creating and editing text files using a basic text editor like Nano.
Assessment:</b></p>

CLI Task Challenge:</b></p>

Assign a set of tasks that require students to use various CLI commands to navigate, create, and manipulate files and directories.

Text Editor Challenge:</b></p>

Ask students to create and edit a text file using a text editor, showcasing their proficiency in basic text editing.

Additional Tips:</b></p>

Interactive Demos: Incorporate live demonstrations to illustrate the execution of commands and their outcomes.

Practice Drills: Allow students to practice repeatedly, as this helps solidify their understanding of commands and operations.

Real-World Context: Connect the concepts to real-world scenarios. Explain how terminal skills are applied in data engineering tasks.

Feedback and Q&A: Provide ample opportunities for students to ask questions and seek clarification on commands and concepts.

Resource Sharing: Share recommended online resources and tutorials for students to continue practicing and learning outside of class.

This revised lesson plan should accurately address the focus on "Basic Terminal Usage" as a part of the "Computer Science Fundamentals" category.
