<b>Objective:</b> Introduce students to the fundamental concepts of working with the command-line interface (CLI) and mastering basic terminal usage.

# Topics Covered:

<b>Introduction to the Command-Line Interface (CLI):</></p>

Understanding the purpose and benefits of using the CLI.
Differentiating between CLI and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Brief history of command-line interfaces.
Navigating the File System:

Using commands like ls, cd, and pwd to navigate and explore the file system.
Understanding the directory structure, paths, and current working directory.
File and Directory Operations:

Creating and deleting directories with mkdir and rmdir.
Creating, copying, moving, and deleting files with touch, cp, mv, and rm.
Text Manipulation:

Viewing file content using cat and less.
Searching within files using grep.
Redirecting input and output with > and >>.
Text Editors:

Introduction to basic text editors like Nano or Vim.
Editing and saving files using a text editor.
Activities and Exercises:

Navigating and Manipulating Files:

Students practice navigating through directories, creating files and directories, and performing basic operations.
Text Manipulation Challenges:

Provide students with text files and ask them to perform specific tasks, such as searching for specific text using grep.
Text Editor Interaction:

Students experiment with creating and editing text files using a basic text editor like Nano.
Assessment:

CLI Task Challenge:

Assign a set of tasks that require students to use various CLI commands to navigate, create, and manipulate files and directories.
Text Editor Challenge:

Ask students to create and edit a text file using a text editor, showcasing their proficiency in basic text editing.
Additional Tips:

Interactive Demos: Incorporate live demonstrations to illustrate the execution of commands and their outcomes.

Practice Drills: Allow students to practice repeatedly, as this helps solidify their understanding of commands and operations.

Real-World Context: Connect the concepts to real-world scenarios. Explain how terminal skills are applied in data engineering tasks.

Feedback and Q&A: Provide ample opportunities for students to ask questions and seek clarification on commands and concepts.

Resource Sharing: Share recommended online resources and tutorials for students to continue practicing and learning outside of class.

This revised lesson plan should accurately address the focus on "Basic Terminal Usage" as a part of the "Computer Science Fundamentals" category.
