# Semester 3: Testing

Lesson 1: Unit Testing

Objective: Teach students the importance of unit testing, how to write effective unit tests, and ensure code quality through test-driven development.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Unit Testing:

Why unit testing is essential in software development.
Benefits of early bug detection and code quality improvement.
Test-Driven Development (TDD):

Principles and process of TDD.
Writing tests before writing the actual code.
Unit Testing Frameworks:

Introduction to popular unit testing frameworks (JUnit, pytest, etc.).
Setting up a unit testing environment in the chosen programming language.
Writing Effective Unit Tests:

Anatomy of a unit test: Arrange, Act, Assert.
Test cases and scenarios: positive, negative, edge cases.
Mocking and Test Doubles:

Creating mock objects and using stubs, spies, and mocks.
Isolating code for effective unit testing.
Test Coverage and Code Quality:

Measuring test coverage and its importance.
Achieving high test coverage and improving code quality.
Continuous Integration and Unit Testing:

Integrating unit tests into a continuous integration workflow.
Automating test execution and reporting.
Activities and Exercises:

Writing Unit Tests:

Students practice writing unit tests for a given piece of code.
Test different scenarios and edge cases to ensure code coverage.
TDD Practice:

Assign coding tasks where students practice test-driven development by writing tests before code.
Assessment:

Unit Test Evaluation:

Evaluate the quality and coverage of students' unit tests.
Assess adherence to best practices in writing effective unit tests.
Additional Tips:

Encourage students to focus on testing isolated units of code.
Provide hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts of TDD and mocking.
This lesson will provide students with a solid foundation in unit testing and how to ensure code quality through thorough testing practices. They will learn about writing effective unit tests, employing test-driven development, and using mocking techniques to isolate code dependencies.
