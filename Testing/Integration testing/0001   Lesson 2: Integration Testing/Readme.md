# Semester 3: Testing

Lesson 1: Integration Testing

Objective: Teach students how to perform integration testing to ensure the correct interaction between different components of a system.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Integration Testing:

Understanding the difference between unit testing and integration testing.
Importance of testing interactions between components.
Integration Test Frameworks:

Overview of integration testing frameworks (TestNG, pytest, etc.).
Setting up an integration testing environment.
Testing Data Flows and APIs:

Testing data flow and communication between different services or components.
Mocking external dependencies for controlled testing.
Database Integration Testing:

Testing interactions with databases.
Using test databases or in-memory databases for isolation.
End-to-End Integration Testing:

Testing complete scenarios across multiple components.
Ensuring integration across different parts of the system.
Continuous Integration and Integration Testing:

Integrating integration tests into CI/CD pipelines.
Running integration tests in different environments.
Activities and Exercises:

Integration Testing Practice:

Students write integration tests for scenarios involving multiple components.
Test different data flows and interaction scenarios.
Database Integration:

Students practice integration testing involving database interactions.
Use in-memory databases or test databases for isolation.
Assessment:

Integration Test Evaluation:

Evaluate the quality and coverage of students' integration tests.
Assess how effectively they ensure proper interactions between components.
Additional Tips:

Provide real-world scenarios where students need to test interactions between various services or components.
Encourage using mocking techniques to isolate external dependencies during integration testing.
