# Lesson 3: Functional Testing

Objective: Introduce students to functional testing, focusing on testing the application's functionality from a user's perspective.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Functional Testing:

Understanding the concept of functional testing.
The role of functional testing in ensuring the application meets user requirements.
Functional Testing Frameworks:

Overview of functional testing frameworks (Selenium, Cypress, etc.).
Setting up a functional testing environment.
Automated UI Testing:

Testing the application's user interface using automated tools.
Writing scripts to simulate user interactions and validate UI behavior.
User Scenario Testing:

Creating test scenarios that mirror user interactions.
Ensuring application functionality across different use cases.
Browser Compatibility Testing:

Testing the application's compatibility across different browsers.
Identifying and addressing browser-specific issues.
Continuous Integration and Functional Testing:

Integrating functional tests into CI/CD pipelines.
Running functional tests on different environments and configurations.
Activities and Exercises:

Automated UI Testing:

Students practice writing automated scripts to test the application's user interface.
Validate UI behavior and interactions.
User Scenario Testing:

Students create and execute test scenarios based on user interactions.
Ensure that the application functions as expected for different use cases.
Assessment:

Functional Test Evaluation:

Evaluate the quality and coverage of students' functional tests.
Assess how effectively they validate the application's functionality from a user perspective.
Additional Tips:

Provide real-world scenarios where students need to simulate user interactions and validate application behavior.
Encourage the use of automated tools for UI testing to ensure efficient testing across different scenarios.
These additional lessons on integration testing and functional testing will further enhance students' understanding of different testing approaches and help them develop a comprehensive testing strategy for their data engineering projects.
