# Lesson 2: Control Structures and Functions

Objective: Teach students how to control program flow using conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.

Topics Covered:

Conditional Statements:

Introduction to if, elif, and else statements.
Using logical operators (and, or, not) for complex conditions.
Loops:

Exploring for and while loops for iteration.
Using loop control statements (break, continue).
Functions:

Defining functions using def.
Parameters, return values, and scoping.
Exception Handling:

Introduction to try, except, and finally blocks for error handling.
Dealing with common exceptions.
Activities and Exercises:

Control Flow Practice:

Students write scripts that use conditional statements and loops for different scenarios.
Function Building:

Assign tasks that involve creating functions to perform specific actions.
Assessment:

Control Structures Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to evaluate students' understanding of control statements and loops.
Function Review:

Ask students to review and test each other's functions.
Additional Tips:

Interactive Examples: Show step-by-step execution of code involving control structures.

Debugging Practice: Teach students how to use print statements and debugging tools to trace code execution.

Hands-On Activities: Engage students in activities where they design their own control structures and functions.

Code Reviews: Introduce the concept of code reviews to improve code quality and learn from peers.

Applied Scenarios: Discuss how control structures and functions are used in data processing pipelines.

Continuing with this structure, you can create subsequent lessons covering more advanced Python topics such as data structures, file handling, object-oriented programming, libraries (like NumPy, pandas), and how Python is used in data engineering specifically (ETL processes, data manipulation, scripting for data pipelines, etc.). Each lesson can include a mix of theory, hands-on exercises, coding challenges, and assessments to ensure comprehensive learning.

Remember to adapt the pace and complexity of the lessons based on the students' prior knowledge and learning progress.
