# Lesson 9: Python Scripting for Data Pipelines

Objective: Teach students how to use Python scripting to build and automate data pipelines for data processing and integration.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Data Pipelines:

Explanation of data pipelines and their importance in data engineering.
Defining Data Pipeline Steps:

Identifying and defining data pipeline stages (extract, transform, load).
Pipeline Configuration:

Creating configuration files for pipeline parameters and settings.
Scripting Workflow:

Building modular scripts for each pipeline stage.
Using command-line arguments for script configuration.
Automation and Scheduling:

Using tools like cron for scheduling pipeline execution.
Implementing error handling and notification mechanisms.
Logging and Monitoring:

Implementing logging to track pipeline activities and errors.
Integrating monitoring tools for pipeline health.
Activities and Exercises:

Pipeline Scripting Exercise:

Assign students tasks to create modular scripts for different stages of a data pipeline.
Pipeline Configuration Challenge:

Assign a task involving creating a configuration file and integrating it with pipeline scripts.
Assessment:

Pipeline Script Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's pipeline scripts.
Pipeline Workflow Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of data pipeline workflow.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Building: Provide step-by-step guidance on building a simple data pipeline.

Interactive Demos: Demonstrate the creation and execution of pipeline scripts in real-time.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of industries where data pipelines are crucial (data warehousing, data integration, ETL).

Best Practices: Discuss best practices for designing maintainable and scalable data pipelines.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to tutorials on building data pipelines with Python.

Use of Libraries: Discuss libraries like luigi or Airflow for more complex pipeline management.

Building and automating data pipelines is a core skill for data engineers, as it enables efficient and reliable data processing. This lesson will equip students with the knowledge to design, implement, and manage data pipelines using Python scripting.
