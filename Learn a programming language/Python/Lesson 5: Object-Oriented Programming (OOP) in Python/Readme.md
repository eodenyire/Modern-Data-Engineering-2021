# Lesson 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Objective: Teach students the principles of object-oriented programming and how to use classes and objects in Python.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to OOP:

Explanation of object-oriented programming concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
Defining Classes:

Creating classes using the class keyword.
Defining attributes and methods within classes.
Creating Objects:

Instantiating objects from classes.
Accessing attributes and calling methods.
Constructor and Destructor:

Understanding the __init__() method as a constructor.
Using the __del__() method as a destructor.
Inheritance:

Explanation of inheritance and superclasses (base classes) and subclasses (derived classes).
Overriding methods and using super().
Polymorphism:

Implementing polymorphism using method overloading and method overriding.
Understanding duck typing.
Activities and Exercises:

Class and Object Practice:

Students create classes representing real-world objects and use them to create objects.
Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Assign tasks involving creating a class hierarchy and demonstrating polymorphic behavior.
Assessment:

OOP Concepts Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of OOP principles and concepts.
Class Design Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's class designs.
Additional Tips:

Visual Aids: Use diagrams to illustrate class hierarchies and the relationship between classes and objects.

Interactive Coding: Perform live coding to demonstrate class and object creation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Practical Examples: Share examples of how OOP is used in data engineering tasks (creating custom data structures, modeling data entities, etc.).

Code Walkthrough: Analyze and discuss real code examples that use OOP concepts.

Real-World Scenarios: Discuss software design patterns and their relevance to data engineering.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to further reading on OOP concepts and best practices.

Understanding object-oriented programming is essential for data engineers, as it enables them to create well-structured and reusable code for data processing tasks, application development, and building data pipelines. This lesson will empower students to design and implement software using OOP principles.
