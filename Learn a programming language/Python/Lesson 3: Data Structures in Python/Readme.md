# Lesson 3: Data Structures in Python

Objective: Teach students about various data structures available in Python and their application in data engineering tasks.

Topics Covered:

Lists:

Introduction to lists as ordered collections of items.
Indexing, slicing, appending, and modifying lists.
Tuples:

Understanding tuples as immutable ordered collections.
Use cases and differences between tuples and lists.
Dictionaries:

Explanation of dictionaries as key-value pairs.
Manipulating dictionaries, accessing values, and adding entries.
Sets:

Introduction to sets as unordered collections of unique elements.
Set operations: union, intersection, difference.
Arrays (NumPy):

Overview of arrays in NumPy for numerical data.
Basic array operations: element-wise operations, slicing.
Activities and Exercises:

List Manipulation:

Students practice creating, modifying, and slicing lists.
Dictionary Challenge:

Assign tasks involving creating and manipulating dictionaries for specific scenarios.
Assessment:

Data Structure Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to evaluate students' understanding of different data structures.
Array Coding Exercise:

Assign a task involving using NumPy arrays to perform basic mathematical operations.
Additional Tips:

Visual Aids: Use diagrams to visually explain how different data structures store and organize data.

Hands-On Practice: Encourage students to experiment with creating and manipulating data structures.

Real-World Examples: Share examples of how data structures are used in data engineering tasks (storing configuration data, processing data records, etc.).

Applied Challenges: Design exercises that require students to use data structures to solve practical problems.

Interactive Demonstrations: Show the benefits of NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computation.

Coding Patterns: Introduce students to common coding patterns for working with data structures.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to official Python documentation for each data structure.

Understanding and effectively using data structures is crucial for data engineers, as they often need to store and manipulate data efficiently during the course of their work. This lesson will empower students with the knowledge to choose the right data structure for specific tasks and scenarios.
