# Lesson 4: File Handling in Python

Objective: Teach students how to work with files in Python for reading, writing, and manipulating data.

Topics Covered:

File I/O Basics:

Introduction to file input and output operations.
Opening, closing, and modes (read, write, append).
Reading from Files:

Reading entire files and reading line by line.
Using with statements for automatic resource management.
Writing to Files:

Writing data to files using write() and writelines() methods.
Understanding buffering and flushing.
File Navigation:

Navigating file positions using seek() and tell() methods.
Reading and writing at specific positions.
Working with CSV Files:

Reading and parsing CSV files using the csv module.
Writing data to CSV files.
Activities and Exercises:

File Reading Practice:

Students write scripts to read data from files and perform simple data manipulation.
CSV Data Processing:

Assign a task that involves reading a CSV file, performing calculations, and writing results to another file.
Assessment:

File Handling Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of file I/O operations and concepts.
CSV Challenge:

Assign a more complex task involving reading and processing data from a CSV file.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Encourage students to work with different types of files (text files, CSV files) during the lesson.

Interactive Demos: Show how to open, read, and write files using real code examples.

Error Handling: Teach students how to handle exceptions that may occur during file operations.

Best Practices: Discuss best practices for file handling, including proper file closing and exception handling.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how file handling is used in data engineering tasks (reading configuration files, writing log files, etc.).

CSV Libraries: Introduce students to the csv module for more structured handling of CSV data.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to Python documentation on file I/O and the csv module.

Mastering file handling is essential for data engineers, as they often need to read and write data to and from various sources. This lesson will equip students with the skills to effectively manage data stored in files, which is a critical aspect of data processing and analysis.
