# Lesson 7: Python in ETL Processes

Objective: Teach students how Python is used in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes for data integration and preparation.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to ETL:

Explanation of ETL processes and their role in data integration and preparation.
Data Extraction:

Using Python to connect to various data sources (databases, APIs, files).
Retrieving and loading data into Python using libraries like pandas.
Data Transformation:

Applying data cleaning, normalization, and transformation using pandas.
Handling missing values, data type conversions, and data reshaping.
Data Loading:

Writing transformed data back to databases or files.
Using libraries like SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
Batch ETL Scripting:

Writing batch ETL scripts that automate the entire ETL process.
Scheduling ETL scripts using tools like cron.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implementing error handling mechanisms to ensure robust ETL processes.
Logging ETL activities for monitoring and troubleshooting.
Activities and Exercises:

Data Extraction Practice:

Students practice connecting to different data sources and loading data into pandas.
Data Transformation Task:

Assign tasks involving cleaning, transforming, and reshaping data using pandas.
Assessment:

ETL Script Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's ETL scripts.
ETL Scenario Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of ETL concepts and scripting.
Additional Tips:

Real Data Sources: Introduce students to real-world data sources for extraction and transformation.

Hands-On Scripts: Provide sample data sets and scripts to demonstrate ETL processes.

Step-by-Step Demonstrations: Walk through the process of creating a complete ETL script.

Data Quality: Discuss strategies for ensuring data quality during ETL, such as data validation and deduplication.

Best Practices: Highlight best practices for designing efficient and maintainable ETL scripts.

Use Cases: Share examples of industries and scenarios where ETL processes are crucial (data warehousing, business intelligence, data migration).

Resource Sharing: Provide links to tutorials on ETL scripting with Python.

Understanding how Python is used in ETL processes is a fundamental skill for data engineers, as ETL is a core part of their responsibilities. This lesson will equip students with the knowledge and skills to extract, transform, and load data effectively from various sources into target systems.
