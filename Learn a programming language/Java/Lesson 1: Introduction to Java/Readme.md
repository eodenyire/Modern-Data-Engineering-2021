# Semester Two: Learn a Programming Language

Section 2: Java

Lesson 1: Introduction to Java

Objective: Introduce students to the Java programming language, its features, and its applications in data engineering.

Topics Covered:

Java Basics:

Overview of Java's syntax and structure.
Writing and running a simple Java program.
Data Types and Variables:

Explanation of primitive data types (int, double, char, boolean).
Using variables, assigning values, and type casting.
Control Structures:

Introduction to if, else, switch, and loop statements (for, while).
Logical operators and conditions.
Functions and Methods:

Defining methods with parameters and return types.
Calling methods and understanding method overloading.
Activities and Exercises:

Hello, Java!:

Students write a basic Java program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
Control Flow Practice:

Assign tasks involving creating conditional statements and loops.
Assessment:

Java Basics Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of Java's basic syntax and concepts.
Code Review:

Ask students to review and explain each other's "Hello, Java!" programs.
Additional Tips:

Interactive Coding: Encourage students to write and execute Java code during the lesson.

Live Coding: Demonstrate coding concepts in real-time to engage students.

IDE Introduction: Introduce an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ or Eclipse.

Resources: Share online Java tutorials and documentation.

Practical Examples: Discuss Java's role in data engineering and its applications in the field.

Applied Exercises: Design exercises that involve solving problems using Java, such as data manipulation tasks.

As with Python, the pace and complexity of the lessons should be tailored to the students' prior knowledge and learning progress. Java is a versatile programming language that can be beneficial for data engineers in various contexts, from building applications to scripting data processing tasks.
