# Lesson 3: Java Libraries and Data Manipulation

Objective: Introduce students to Java libraries commonly used for data manipulation and analysis.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Java Libraries:

Overview of commonly used Java libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
Working with Arrays and Collections:

Using arrays and Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Map).
Iterating over collections and performing operations.
Stream API:

Introduction to Java Stream API for functional-style data processing.
Transforming and filtering data using streams.
File Handling in Java:

Reading and writing data to files using Java's I/O classes.
Handling exceptions and using try-with-resources.
Activities and Exercises:

Collection Manipulation:

Students practice using collections and performing operations using loops and streams.
File Handling Exercise:

Assign tasks involving reading and writing data to files using Java I/O.
Assessment:

Library Usage Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of Java libraries for data manipulation.
Collection Code Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's collection manipulation code.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Provide real-world data manipulation tasks and guide students to solve them using Java libraries.

Live Coding: Demonstrate how to work with arrays, collections, and streams using code examples.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to Java documentation and tutorials for the discussed libraries.

Use Cases: Share examples of how these libraries are used in data engineering tasks (data preprocessing, analysis, etc.).

Interactive Coding: Encourage students to participate in coding sessions to manipulate data using Java libraries.

Applied Challenges: Design exercises that involve solving practical data manipulation problems.

Mastering Java libraries for data manipulation is essential for data engineers, as it equips them with the tools to process and analyze data efficiently. This lesson will empower students to handle data manipulation tasks using Java's features and libraries.
