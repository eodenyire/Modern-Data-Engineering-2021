# Lesson 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Objective: Teach students the principles of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to OOP in Java:

Explanation of OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.
Defining Classes and Objects in Java:

Creating classes using the class keyword.
Defining attributes, methods, constructors, and access modifiers.
Constructors and Method Overloading:

Using constructors for object initialization.
Method overloading and its significance.
Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Implementing inheritance using the extends keyword.
Method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
Encapsulation and Access Control:

Encapsulation principles and data hiding.
Access control modifiers: public, private, protected, default.
Activities and Exercises:

Class and Object Creation:

Students create classes representing real-world objects in Java.
Inheritance Practice:

Assign tasks involving creating a class hierarchy and demonstrating polymorphic behavior.
Assessment:

OOP Concepts Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of OOP principles in Java.
Class Design Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's class designs.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Coding: Provide students with coding exercises that involve creating classes and objects.

Interactive Demonstrations: Show the creation of classes, objects, and the inheritance hierarchy.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how Java's OOP concepts are used in data engineering tasks.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to Java tutorials and documentation on OOP.

Applied Exercises: Design exercises that require students to solve practical problems using Java's OOP features.

Understanding object-oriented programming in Java is essential for data engineers, as it helps them create modular and organized code for data engineering tasks. This lesson will empower students to design and implement software using OOP principles in the Java programming language.
