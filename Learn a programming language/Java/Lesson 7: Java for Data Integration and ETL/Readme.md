Explanation of data integration and its significance in data engineering.
Data Extraction:

Using Java to extract data from various sources (databases, APIs, files).
Retrieving and loading data into Java using appropriate libraries.
Data Transformation:

Applying data cleaning, normalization, and transformation using Java.
Handling data inconsistencies and transformations.
Data Loading:

Writing transformed data back to databases or files using Java.
Automation and Scheduling:

Automating ETL processes using Java and scheduling with tools like cron.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implementing error handling mechanisms and logging for ETL processes.
Activities and Exercises:

Data Extraction and Transformation:

Students practice extracting and transforming data using Java.
Automating ETL Tasks:

Assign tasks involving writing Java code to automate ETL processes.
Assessment:

Data Integration Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of using Java for data integration and ETL.
ETL Script Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's ETL scripts.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Provide real-world data integration and ETL tasks and guide students to implement them using Java.

Interactive Demonstrations: Demonstrate how to extract, transform, and load data using Java.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how Java is used for data integration and ETL in data engineering tasks.

Resource Sharing: Provide links to tutorials and documentation on using Java for ETL.

Efficiency and Scalability: Discuss strategies for optimizing ETL processes for efficiency and scalability.

Applied Exercises: Design exercises that require students to implement practical data integration and ETL tasks.

Proficiency in using Java for data integration and ETL processes is essential for data engineers, as it enables them to efficiently combine and transform data from various sources. This lesson will equip students with the skills needed to handle data integration tasks using Java.
