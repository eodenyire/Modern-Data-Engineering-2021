# Lesson 5: Java and Databases

Objective: Teach students how to interact with databases using Java and perform database operations.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Databases:

Overview of databases and their importance in data engineering.
Connecting to Databases:

Using Java's JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to databases.
Establishing connections, creating statements, and managing resources.
Executing SQL Queries:

Sending SQL queries using Java's JDBC.
Retrieving and processing query results.
Working with Prepared Statements:

Using prepared statements for parameterized queries.
Preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Transaction Management:

Understanding database transactions and their importance.
Implementing transaction management in Java.
Activities and Exercises:

Database Connection Setup:

Students practice establishing connections to databases using JDBC.
Executing Queries:

Assign tasks involving writing Java code to execute SQL queries and process results.
Assessment:

Database Interaction Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of using Java with databases.
SQL Query Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's Java code for executing SQL queries.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Provide exercises involving various types of SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) using Java and JDBC.

Interactive Demonstrations: Demonstrate how to connect to databases, execute queries, and manage transactions using Java code.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how Java is used to interact with databases in data engineering tasks (data retrieval, data insertion, etc.).

Resource Sharing: Provide links to tutorials and documentation on using Java with databases.

Use of ORM Frameworks: Introduce Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate for more advanced database interactions.

Applied Exercises: Design exercises that require students to solve practical database-related problems.

Proficiency in interacting with databases using Java is essential for data engineers, as databases are a fundamental part of data storage and retrieval. This lesson will equip students with the skills needed to connect to databases, execute queries, and manage data using Java.
