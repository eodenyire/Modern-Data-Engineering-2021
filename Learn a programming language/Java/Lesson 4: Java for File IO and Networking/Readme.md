# Lesson 4: Java for File I/O and Networking

Objective: Teach students how to work with files, handle input/output operations, and perform networking tasks using Java.

Topics Covered:

File Input/Output in Java:

Overview of Java's File I/O classes and operations.
Reading and writing text and binary data to files.
Exception Handling:

Understanding Java's exception hierarchy and handling exceptions.
Using try, catch, finally blocks.
Networking in Java:

Introduction to Java's networking classes for client-server communication.
Working with sockets, server sockets, and network streams.
Working with URLs and HTTP:

Using Java's URL and URLConnection classes to work with URLs.
Sending HTTP requests and receiving responses.
Activities and Exercises:

File Reading and Writing:

Students practice reading and writing data to files using Java's File I/O classes.
Exception Handling Practice:

Assign tasks involving writing code that handles various exceptions.
Assessment:

File I/O Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of Java's File I/O operations.
Networking Code Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's networking code.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Provide exercises that involve reading and writing various types of data (text, binary) to files.

Interactive Demos: Demonstrate how to handle exceptions and perform network operations using Java.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how Java's file I/O and networking are used in data engineering tasks (data transfer, web scraping, etc.).

Resource Sharing: Provide links to Java documentation and tutorials on file I/O and networking.

Use of Libraries: Discuss third-party libraries that can simplify file I/O and networking tasks in Java.

Applied Exercises: Design exercises that require students to solve practical file I/O and networking problems.

Proficiency in file I/O operations and networking is crucial for data engineers, as they often need to read from and write to files and interact with external data sources. This lesson will equip students with the skills needed to handle these tasks using Java.
