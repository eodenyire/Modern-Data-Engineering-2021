Large Dataset Processing Task:

Assign a task involving processing a large dataset using Java's memory-efficient techniques.
Assessment:

Data Processing Quiz:

Conduct a quiz to assess students' understanding of data processing techniques in Java.
Code Review:

Ask students to review and provide feedback on each other's data processing code.
Additional Tips:

Hands-On Practice: Provide real-world datasets and guide students to clean, transform, and analyze the data using Java.

Interactive Coding: Demonstrate how to perform data processing tasks using Java code examples.

Real-World Scenarios: Share examples of how Java is used to process and clean data in data engineering tasks (data preprocessing, data transformation).

Resource Sharing: Provide links to tutorials and resources on data processing using Java.

Efficiency Considerations: Discuss strategies for optimizing data processing code for performance and memory usage.

Applied Challenges: Design exercises that require students to solve practical data processing problems.

Proficiency in data processing and analysis using Java is essential for data engineers, as they often need to prepare and clean data for downstream tasks. This lesson will empower students to perform these tasks efficiently using Java.
