Data Source Integration:

Integrating various data sources into the pipeline.
Data Transformation and Enrichment:

Applying data transformation and enrichment techniques using Scala.
Data Processing and Analysis:

Processing and analyzing data using Scala.
Real-Time Stream Processing:

Implementing real-time stream processing components.
Data Storage and Visualization:

Storing data and creating visualizations using Scala.
Activities and Exercises:

Project Development:
Students work on building a complete data pipeline using Scala, incorporating all stages from data ingestion to visualization.
Assessment:

Capstone Project Evaluation:
Evaluate students' capstone projects based on the completeness, quality, and functionality of their data pipelines.
Additional Tips:

Guided Project: Provide a detailed project outline, requirements, and milestones for students to follow.

Feedback and Iteration: Encourage students to receive feedback during the project's development phase and make necessary improvements.

Peer Collaboration: Allow students to collaborate and share insights as they work on their projects.

Presentation and Demonstration: Ask students to present and demonstrate their data pipelines to the class.

The capstone project serves as a culmination of the students' learning journey, where they apply their Scala skills to build a complete data pipeline. This project will reinforce their understanding of Scala's role in data engineering and provide them with a tangible portfolio piece to showcase their skills to potential employers.
